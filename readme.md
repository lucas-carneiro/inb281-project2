# 2.5D Platform: Advanced Game Design Project 2

Game developed for the Advanced Game Design (INB281) class at QUT (Queensland University of Technology).

### Description:

Play around with the provided game mechanics to get a feel for how the game works. Take some time to look at the provided player and enemy objects to see how their model, scripts and animations tie together. Plan and design a conceptual model of the game you wish to make (concept art, pseudo code etc). Create an interesting 2.5D platform game, using but not limited to the following tools, objects and assets:
- Animations (e.g. moving platforms, additional player/enemy animations etc)
- Particle Systems (attack effects, damage effects, hazards, powerups etc)
- Simple GUI elements (health, lives, timer etc)
- Lights and Audio Sources
- A player character controlled via side-scrolling (provided)
- Several enemy NPCs (provided)

##### Deliverable:
At the end of this activity it is expected that you have experimented with the software and your version of the game has the following elements:
- A Level Design that displays a goal (i.e. objective or purpose in the game) and loss condition (i.e. losing the game through some means)
- Two ends states
    - A goal (i.e. objective or purpose in the game) as described in the level design
    - A loss condition (i.e. how the player loses the game)
- A death animation on the player
- A combat mechanic so that the spiders can be defeated
    - Spider has a total amount of health / life
    - Spider takes damage as a result of some event (eg. being jumped on)
    - Spider is removed from the scene upon losing all health
- A timer that displays how long the player has been in the current game
- Display the current time elapsed since starting the game on the screen as part of your Heads Up Display (HUD)

##### Suggestions (non-deliverable but useful):

    New GUI system tutorial

    Artificial Intelligence Scripting
        Basic Finite State Machine (Warning! This is more difficult)    

    Mecanim System
        This newer animation system makes animation management easier, makes transitions smoother, and also makes animations easily moveable between different characters
